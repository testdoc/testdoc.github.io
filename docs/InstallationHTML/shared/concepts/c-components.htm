                    <li><strong>OpenStack</strong> is the underlying platform technology of <span>CLC</span>. It allows for the deployment and management of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platforms.<p>For details, refer to the <a href="http://www.openstack.org/" target="_blank"><u>OpenStack</u></a> documentation.</p>
</li>

                    <li>After installation of <span>CLC</span>, the <strong>Cluster Management</strong> component is set up, which provides all artefacts and tools required for provisioning a cluster. Cluster Management utilizes the resources provided by the underlying OpenStack platform. <p>It comprises a <strong>Cluster Management UI</strong> and <strong>Cluster Provisioning</strong>.</p>
<p>The Cluster Management UI is a graphical user interface integrated in the OpenStack dashboard for the cluster operator to request the automatic setup of a cluster and to manage clusters on an infrastructure level. It is implemented as a plugin that extends the OpenStack dashboard (<strong>Horizon plugin</strong>).</p>
<p>Cluster Provisioning allows for the automatic set up of clusters based on resources provided by OpenStack and to set up Cluster Orchestration (Kubernetes). Based on the input values specified through the Cluster Management UI, instructions for provisioning the cluster are created and passed to the OpenStack Orchestration (<strong>Heat</strong>) system. </p>
</li>

                    <li>Predefined Heat orchestration templates (HOT) are part of the <span>CLC</span> Horizon plugin. Heat is responsible for the actual creation of the resources (for example, VMs, volumes, etc.) as well as the installation and configuration of the Cluster Orchestration on top of the created resources.</li>

                    <li>A cluster always comprises at least one master and one worker node. The master is the controlling unit in the cluster and serves as the main management contact point for administrators. Worker nodes communicate with the master, configure the networking for containers, and run the actual workloads assigned to them. The <strong>Docker service</strong> is used to run encapsulated application containers in a relatively isolated but lightweight operating environment. </li>

                    <li>As part of the <span>CLC</span> installation, a preassembled <strong>CentOS Atomic</strong> host image is uploaded and registered in the OpenStack environment. Each node in the cluster is provisioned with this base image. </li>

                    <li>The command-line interface (CLI) of the Cluster Orchestration is used for maintenance and troubleshooting purposes, as well as for deploying the actual workloads onto the cluster nodes. The <span>CLC</span> installation package contains the latest binaries of the CLI so that interaction with the master is instantly possible. </li>

                </ol>
