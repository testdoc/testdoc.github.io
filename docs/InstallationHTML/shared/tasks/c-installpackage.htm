        <div class="section">
            <p>The <span>CLC</span> tools and artefacts are provided on the <span>CLC</span> installation medium, and come as a folder structure on the file system. </p>

            <p>Copy this folder structure to a separate folder on the host where you want to install
                <span>CLC</span>. </p>

            <p>In case of an automatic installation, this can be any host from which SSH access is possible to the host where the OpenStack dashboard (Horizon) is installed. The <span>CLC</span> installer copies all required files to the Horizon host. In case of a manual installation, this must be the host where Horizon is installed.</p>

            <p>In the following sections, this folder is referred to as <samp class="codeph">&lt;InstDir&gt;</samp>. It consists of the following subfolders:</p>

            <div class="p">
                <ul>
                    <li><samp class="codeph">auto-installation</samp> folder:<p>Contains all artefacts required for automatically installing <span>CLC</span> to an existing OpenStack environment. </p>

                        <p>For details, refer to <a href="../../installation/chapter-3/c-install.htm">Automatically Installing CLC</a>.</p>

<p><samp class="codeph">/horizon-wlm-plugin</samp>: <span>CLC</span> plugin for the OpenStack Horizon dashboard including Heat orchestration templates (HOT) for the automatic orchestration of Kubernetes clusters. </p>
<p><samp class="codeph">/image</samp>: Atomic CentOS base image for the cluster nodes. </p>

                        <p>For details, refer to <a href="../../installation/chapter-4/c-install.htm">Manually Installing CLC</a>.</p>

                    <li><samp class="codeph">evaluation-installation</samp> folder: <p>Contains all artefacts required for the stand-alone evaluation installation of <span>CLC</span>
                            <span>by means of a setup based on Vagrant. With this setup, a DevStack-based OpenStack environment is created, and <span>CLC</span> is automatically installed on top of it. If you would like to try this installation, contact your Fujitsu Support organization</span>.</p>

                    <li><samp class="codeph">examples</samp> folder: <p>Contains sample files for a guestbook tutorial which walks you through building a simple, multi-tier Web application and deploying it to a Kubernetes cluster. </p>

                    <li><samp class="codeph">doc</samp> folder: <p>Contains the user documentation for <span>CLC</span>.</p>

                    <li><samp class="codeph">cli</samp> folder: <p>Contains the binaries of the Kubernetes command-line interface (CLI) which you can use for working with the nodes in a Kubernetes cluster after having installed <span>CLC</span>.</p>
