    <div>
        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Cloud</h4>
            
            <p>A metaphor for the Internet and an abstraction of the underlying infrastructure it conceals. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Container</h4>
            
            <p>A Linux-based technology, where a single kernel runs multiple instances on a single operating system. Containers form an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level virtualization.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Cluster</h4>
            
            <p>A group of servers and other resources that act like a single system and enable high availability, load balancing and parallel processing. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">DevStack</h4>
            
            <p>The OpenStack development environment. It can be used to demonstrate starting and running OpenStack services and provide examples of using them from a command line. DevStack has evolved to support a large number of configuration options and alternative platforms and support services. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Docker</h4>
            
            <p>An Open Source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers. Docker uses resource isolation features of the Linux kernel to allow independent containers to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Flavor</h4>
            
            <p>A virtual hardware template used in OpenStack for defining the compute, memory, and storage capacity of a virtual server. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Heat</h4>
            
            <p>A service to orchestrate multiple composite cloud applications.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h4>
            
            <p>The delivery of computer infrastructure (typically a platform virtualization environment) as a service.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Label</h4>
            
            <p>In the context of cluster orchestration, a facility for organizing and selecting groups of objects based on key-value pairs.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h4>
            
            <p>The delivery of a computing platform and solution stack as a service.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Pod</h4>
            
            <p>An application-specific logical host in a containerized environment. Pods may contain one or more tightly coupled containers. </p>

            <p>Pods are the smallest deployable units that can be created, scheduled, and managed by Kubernetes. Pods can be created individually, the usage of <em>Replication Controllers</em>, however, is recommended.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Replication Controller</h4>
            
            <p>An abstraction which ensures that a specific number of <em>Pod</em> replicas are running at all times. If a pod or host goes down, the replication controller ensures that enough pods get recreated elsewhere. A replication controller manages the lifecycle of pods.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Service</h4>
            
            <p>In the context of cluster orchestration, a layer of abstraction for providing a single, stable name and address for accessing a set of <em>Pods</em>. Services act as basic load balancers. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Software as a Service (SaaS)</h4>
            
            <p>A model of software deployment where a provider licenses an application to customers for use as a service on demand.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Stack</h4>
            
            <p>A set of OpenStack resources created and managed by the Orchestration service according to a given template (in <span>CLC</span>, a Heat Orchestration Template (HOT)).</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Tenant</h4>
            
            <p>A group of users in OpenStack. Also referred to as "project".  </p>

        </div>

        <div class="section"><h4 class="sectiontitle">Workload</h4>
            
            <p>Abstraction of the actual amount of work that applications or services perform in a given period of time, or the average amount of work handled by an application or service at a particular point in time. </p>
