                                        <li>The OpenStack operator installs <span>CLC</span> on top of OpenStack. The OpenStack operator can use an automated setup or follow manual step-by-step instructions as provided in the <em>Installation Guide</em>.<p>In addition, for a stand-alone evaluation of <span>CLC</span>, a setup based on Vagrant is provided. With this setup, a DevStack-based OpenStack environment is created, and <span>CLC</span> is automatically installed on top of it. If you want to try this installation, please contact your Fujitsu Support organization.</p>
</li>

                                        <li>The installation process automatically sets up the <strong>Cluster Management</strong> component which provides all artefacts and tools required for provisioning a cluster. Cluster Management utilizes the resources provided by the underlying OpenStack platform. <p>Cluster Management comprises a <strong>Cluster Management UI</strong> and Cluster Provisioning which integrates seamlessly with the OpenStack dashboard (<a href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/horizon/" target="_blank"><u>Horizon</u></a>). It extends the dashboard with a panel for cluster management. </p>

                    </li>

                                        <li>The Cluster operator uses the Cluster Management UI for creating and deleting clusters, as well as getting an overview of all existing clusters and their current state. <p><strong>Cluster Provisioning</strong> is triggered when the cluster operator requests the creation of a new cluster. The operator provides the required information, for example, number of nodes to be provisioned, or access keys in the Cluster Management UI.</p>
</li>

                                        <li>Based on the input values, instructions for provisioning the cluster are created and passed to the <strong>OpenStack Orchestration</strong> (<strong>Heat</strong>) system. Heat is responsible for the actual creation of the resources (for example, VMs, volumes, etc.) as well as the installation and configuration of the<strong> Cluster Orchestration</strong> (Kubernetes) on top of the created resources.</li>

                                        <li>The cluster operator uses the command-line interface (<strong>CLI</strong>) of the Cluster Orchestration for maintenance and troubleshooting purposes, as well as for retrieving the usage of the underlying resources, such as CPU and memory. </li>

                                        <li>The cluster user deploys the actual workloads into the Docker containers using the CLI of the Cluster Orchestration.</li>
